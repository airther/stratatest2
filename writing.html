						<h1>Brotherly Love</h1>
								Last week, our humble Philly office had some guests. 
								They were a team of TFA staff visiting from around the 
								country to discuss our impact in local communities. So,
								 we showed them our classrooms and introduced them to
								  our students. We talked about race, poverty, 
								  politics, vision, and strategy. We discussed our
								   successes and our, ahem, less-than-successes. In 
								   return, they explained how our endeavors in Philly
								    relate to those of TFA staff and corps members 
								    across the country.
								<br><br>
								It was fitting to have such a get together in the 
								city of <b>brotherly love</b>. We here in the office call 
								ourselves the “Philly Pham,” but we sometimes forget
								 we’re part of a larger tribe, with our TFA kinfolk 
								 doing the same work across America. Some of us are 
								 in our 20s and others are nearing retirement, but 
								 we’re all linked in our wholehearted commitment to 
								 the same cause.
								<br><br>
								And that brings me to the “love” bit of “brotherly 
								love.” One visitor last week was a founding Philly 
								corps member from 2003. Holding back tears, he spoke 
								of the kids he taught and the desire he had to always
								 do <i>more</i>. Those experiences are why, he said, he’s 
								 on staff at TFA today – to continue making a 
								 difference. It was hard to miss the love in his voice.
								<br><br>
								But love takes work, and there’s a heck of a lot of 
								work to be done in our schools. While you won’t 
								single-handedly resolve the systemic issues depriving 
								Philly’s kids of an equitable education, one day you 
								can say you were part of the movement in this country 
								that <i>did</i>.

							<h1>Uncomfortable Questions</h1>
								What do you think when you hear “light skin” vs. 
								“dark skin”? Is “you’re pretty for a dark-skin girl” 
								considered a compliment? Are you comfortable with 
								your skin color?
 								<br><br>
								And are you comfortable with these questions?
								<br><br>
								Well, Philly students are. Last week, local high 
								school students released a 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/gaPyW5DuzSU" target="_blank">video</a> 
								titled, 
								“<a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/02/11/when-black-teens-get-real-about-americas-love-light-skin" target="_blank">For the 
								Love of Brown Girls</a>.” In a mere 10 minutes, these 
								teenagers cover more ground than some classes do 
								in an entire semester. Colorism, racism, misogyny, 
								intersectionality, implicit bias, the influence of 
								mass media - they press the topics that even some 
								adults can’t handle. They don’t always have the 
								answers, but there’s no shortage of questions:
								<br><br>
								<blockquote>
									Where did this even come from?
									<br>
									How do you <b>learn</b> how not to love yourself?
									<br>
									Or, how do you <b>learn</b> how to not love yourself?
									<br>
									How do you <b>learn</b> to put down your own kin?
									<br>
									How to put down your own race?
									<br>
									How to put down the woman who looks closest like you, 
									<br>
									who’ll make the most beautiful babies with you, 
									<br>
									who is always gonna root for you for your entire life?
 								</blockquote>
								<br>
								If prejudice can be learned, then it can be 
								unlearned. If hate can be learned, then so can 
								love. In a city that 
								<a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/02/11/philadelphia-ranks-among-worst-cities-for-valentines-day/" target="_blank">needs all the love it can 
								get</a>, we lead for the love of our students. That 
								means asking the uncomfortable questions, hearing 
								the difficult answers, and always bringing something 
								to the (classroom) table. Is it challenging? Of 
								course. Should we as leaders fear challenges? 
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaPyW5DuzSU&feature=youtu.be&t=2m43s" target="_blank">Hell no</a>.

							<h1>The Heritage City</h1>
							The city of Philadelphia has a lot to celebrate from its 
							past. Founded in 1683, Philly today still retains most of 
							its original street & city plan. In the 1700s, 
							Independence Hall birthed the Declaration of 
							Independence and United States Constitution. Philly was 
							the capital of government and finance in the 18th 
							century, an industrial powerhouse in the 19th century, 
							and a commercial & cultural hub in the 20th. According 
							to the 
							<a href="http://www.ovpm.org/en/cities/philadelphia" target="_blank">OWHC</a>, 
							it was these achievements that led to 
							Philadelphia being named the USA’s first World 
							Heritage City last year.
							<br><br>
							But you’ll notice something missing from the above 
							account. As it currently stands, Philly is 44% 
							Black / African-American. Its history, then, is largely 
							African-American history. Last week, we in the Philly 
							Pham had an all-staff session to probe our collective 
							knowledge of this rich past. We knew that Philly 
							residents attend influential black churches and some 
							of the most important HBCUs. Billie Holiday, Patti 
							LaBelle, and Questlove were born in the city. The 
							Black Panther Party held a 
							<a href="https://washingtonspark.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/black-panther-party-revolutionary-peoples-convention-november-1970/" target="_blank">convention</a> 
							at Temple 
							University, Mumia Abu-Jamal was 
							<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-07/news/mn-32423_1_mumia-abu-jamal" target="_blank">tried</a> 
							at City Hall, 
							and the headquarters of the radical group MOVE was 
							<i>literally 
							<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/05/13/406243272/im-from-philly-30-years-later-im-still-trying-to-make-sense-of-the-move-bombing" target="_blank">bombed</a></i> 
							by the police on Osage Avenue.
							<br><br>
							It’s a lot to cover in a mere month – even with 
							the 
							<a href="https://youtu.be/xX96xng7sAE" target="_blank">extra day</a>. 
							There’s no way such a limited amount 
							of time can capture the entirety of Philly residents’ 
							stories & achievements. So as February comes to a 
							close, I ask you to commit to extending the celebration 
							of black history throughout the year, throughout your 
							lessons as a teacher, and, if all goes according to 
							plan, throughout your students’ lives.
