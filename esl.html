						<p>
							As an ESL teacher in China, a colleague of mine asked rhetorically,
							"What can we (as native speakers) provide our students that their 
							English books and local teachers cannot?" His conclusion was that, 
							native speakers are especially well positioned 
							to catch and correct errors in pronunciation, in a way that 
							Chinese teachers (who had also learned English as 
							a second language) and inert textbooks could not. Intrigued by 
							this observation, I researched the frequency and causes of 
							mispronunciation by Chinese students. 
							<br><br>
							One of the primary factors, I found, is that Chinese dialects do 
							not contain all of the phonemes 
							present in English, such that students will substitute sounds from
							their native language for the intended English phoneme. (This is an 
							example of what is often called "native language interference.") 
							Worse yet, even some of the 
							phonemes that <i>are</i> shared with by thr native dialect are 
							misapplied by English learners due to aural or orthographic 
							misunderstandings. A student may hear or read an English sound
							as one phoneme when it is actually supposed to be another, 
							<i> even though both sounds are present in their native language</i>.
							<br><br>
							I decided to formulate a multi-pronged approach to help students
							better understand and produce phonetic distinctions by using 
							minimal pairs, an explicit understanding of physical articulation,
							and other techniques. I used dialogs, a popular ESL teaching device,
							to frame these pronunciation lessons and to provide conversation
							starters for class discussion (which seasoned ESL teachers will
							recognize as one of the more engaging parts of class for many 
							students). I have shared these dialogs and supporting materials below
							as a <b>starting point</b> for other ESL teachers looking to build 
							pronunciation lessons for their own students.

						<h1>Hugged or Kissed?</h1>
							<h3>Dialog</h3>

									<b>B</b> I didn’t kiss him! He only hugged me.<br>
									<b>A</b> Oh! In other words, you acted like friends!

								<h3>Pronunciation Practice</h3>
										What is the past tense of these verbs? How is the "-ed" suffix pronounced?
												<li>Walk</li>
												<li>Need</li>
												<li>Cry</li>
												<li>Wait</li>
												<li>Love</li>
												<li>Stop</li>
								<br>
								<h3>Pronunciation: Connected Speech</h3>
								The final "-ed" sound can be connected to the next word in the sentence without pause if the next word begins with
								a vowel sound. This can also be done with pronouns or helping verbs that beging with "h", such as:
									<li>he</li>
									<li>his</li>
									<li>her</li>
									<li>him</li>
									<li>has</li>
									<li>have</li>
								This is called h-deletion. Below are some examples of connected speech using h-deletion:
